It’s got that 'Bacon' look we love—consistent patterns from the neck all the way down. This little one is growing well and has a great appetite for Repashy.",

        description: "This gecko has a really cool, high-contrast look with bright orange stripes sitting over a nice light base. It’s a great-looking animal that would be perfect for a display tank where you want something that really pops. Personality-wise, it’s been very easy to work with and is growing perfectly. It's a very reliable eater and has been raised exclusively on Repashy.",
